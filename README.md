#Projekt zaliczeniowy fiszek 

On lanuch:
 - User can add Question and Answer to table to generate set of flashcards
 OR
 - User can load .json prepared file to automaticly load set of flashcards
When clicked "Start" button:
 - Big rectangle with visible question of randomly picked flashcard from loaded set
 - Below there is "Reveal" button that will show answer for question
When clicked "Reveal" button:
 - Two buttons gonna show up. Red "X" button and green "✔" button

When clicked "X" button:
- Shown flashcard will disappear and be thrown into stack of flashcards that are not answered correctly. Everything from this stack will appear again when "active" stack will be empty

When clicked "✔" button:
- Shown flashcard will disappear and be thrown into stack of flashcards answered correctly and won't be shown again

After user will go through all firstly loaded set of flashcards the program will show statistics of flashcards answered correctly and incorrectly
There will be "End" button to exit program and "Continue" button to continue learning all flashcards that were not answered correctly.
There will be also "Export" button to export all incorrectly answered flashcards into .json file that can be loaded into app again
